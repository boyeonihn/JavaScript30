# JavaScript30 Project 

## What is it: 
It is a 30 day course to engage in JavaScript programming, created by Full Stack Developer Wes Bos. 

If you would like to take a stab at the course yourself, please grab the course at [https://JavaScript30.com](https://JavaScript30.com)!


## The Why: 
I created this repository to document all the JavaScript projects that I completed as part of this course. As much as I love solving codewars katas, I found myself needing practice in building projects of a wider, bigger scope. 

How it's made: I kept the original "Start" and "Finished" files provided by Wes Bos, but added my own solution files. If I attempted the project multiple times, there would be multiples of my own solution files. 

Tech used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
